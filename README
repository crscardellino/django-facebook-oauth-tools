Other packages I've seen have too many constants and assumptions built-in 
(such as which facebook permissions your app needs). As with most of my 
github shares, I'm going for a less gun-to-your-head feature approach with
this app.

-I needed more granular permission checks/requests--instead of a bulk of
them up front, certain features require certain permissions.

-I needed automatic redirect support for joining a user with the page they
abandoned.

-I wanted some additional tools for connecting local users to a Fan page so
I could give my fans goodies.

-I wanted a data API that provided a loose way to make repetitive tasks
tidy. For hard things, bust out URLLIB yourself and hit Graph directly.
